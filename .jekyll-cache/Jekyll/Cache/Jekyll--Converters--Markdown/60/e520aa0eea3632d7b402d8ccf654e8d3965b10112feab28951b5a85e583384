I"<p>We are excited to announce that the Universidade do Minho team, from the ISISE - Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering, has published a paper as part of the RecycleBIM Project. Titled:</p>

<p>“Promoting circularity of construction materials through demolition digitalisation at the preparation stage: Information requirements and openBIM-based technological implementation.”</p>

<p>This paper explores how BIM can be leveraged at the end-of-life stage of assets, focusing on promoting the circularity of secondary construction products. By integrating digitalisation with BIM, the research outlines how demolition processes can be optimized to enhance the reuse and recycling of valuable materials.</p>

<p>One of the key highlights of this work is the implementation of openBIM technologies, setting up independent workflows aimed at promoting more sustainable practices across the construction industry.</p>

<p>This is an important step of the project, and we are thrilled to contribute to this evolving field! If you’re interested in how digital tools like BIM are transforming waste management and sustainability in construction, we invite you to explore the full publication here:
