We are sharing an article that explains the basics of the BIM Execution Plan (BEP) and its role in managing information in construction projects. The article presents a case study from the RecycleBIM Project, showing how the BEP was applied in both demolition and new construction contexts.

As part of the RecycleBIM Project (WP2), a BEP was developed specifically for projects focused on demolition and deconstruction. The goal was to improve planning and reuse of materials through digital modeling and structured information exchange. The project also explored BEP use in new construction, especially where energy analysis and sustainability were key requirements.

The BEP templates created in RecycleBIM include clear sections on roles, deliverables, software used, and data management strategies. This structured approach helps teams collaborate, keep track of responsibilities, and manage project information more effectively.

Having a BEP in place helps ensure that BIM processes are organized and aligned with project needs. It supports smoother collaboration and helps teams meet both technical and contractual requirements.
