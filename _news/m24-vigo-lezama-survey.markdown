In April, the RecycleBIM Project team, including members from Lezama Demoliciones and Universidade de Vigo, executed a comprehensive site scan and pre-demolition audit, strictly adhering to the project methodology. This marks a significant step in the rigorous testing and validation of the RecycleBIM approach through real case studies.

The project focuses on evaluating the reuse and recycling potential of building materials and products, with a Building Information Model (BIM) serving as the central database. Utilizing advanced scanning techniques, the team captures detailed building data, which is then processed by smart algorithms for modeling purposes. The critical information gathered from the pre-demolition audit, in line with the project's information requirements, feeds into the BIM model.

Currently, the Universidade do Minho team is working on translating this data into a comprehensive BIM model for further analysis and processing.
