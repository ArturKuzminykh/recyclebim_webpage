We are excited to share that the RecycleBIM Project is now a member of the Circular Construction Cluster (CCC), an initiative established by the RECONMATIC Horizon Europe project.

The CCC brings together projects, academic institutions, and industry stakeholders to collaborate on improving construction and demolition waste management. Its mission extends beyond the development of technologies such as AI, robotics, automation, and digital twins. The cluster focuses on fostering collaboration, offering regulatory recommendations, and advancing the manufacturing of recycled and reused construction materials.

Our membership in the CCC aligns with our goal of promoting sustainable practices in construction. We look forward to sharing our knowledge and learning from fellow members to enhance sustainability across the industry.
