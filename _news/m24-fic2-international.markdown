Excited to share that on May 24th, the RecycleBIM Project was presented at the International Science Fair "FIC²" (Feira Internacional Curtir Ciência) in Guimarães!

FIC² brought together a vibrant community of researchers, cutting-edge projects, and advanced technologies in Science and Technology. Our coordinators, Manuel Parente and Miguel Azenha, did an excellent job presenting the project's innovations and engaging with the audience.

Together, we're spreading knowledge and fostering a sustainable future!
