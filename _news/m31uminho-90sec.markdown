We are excited to announce that the RecycleBIM Project was recently highlighted on the science program, 90 Segundos de Ciência!

Miguel Azenha, project coordinator, professor at the Universidade do Minho, and researcher at ISISE - Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering, shared valuable insights about the project’s progress and goals.

The project is currently advancing through the validation of case studies, a critical phase in demonstrating the practical application of the methodologies developed. This work supports the wider goal of promoting sustainable practices in construction and demolition.

We are eager to continue sharing updates as we make progress in this important field. Stay tuned for more developments as we work toward more sustainable solutions for the construction industry.
