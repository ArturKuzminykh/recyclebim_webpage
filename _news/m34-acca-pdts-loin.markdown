Our partner in the RecycleBIM Project, ACCA software, recently published an article on the essential aspects of Product Data Templates and Level of Information Need specifications, highlighting their role in efficient material reuse and recycling with digitalised workflows. 
The publication explains how structured data management and BIM can facilitate reducing construction waste by optimising demolition processes using digital tools and ensuring interoperability through open standards like IFC schema.
The work was elaborated in the project's scope of WP2 (BIM data specifications). We thank our partners, ACCA software, for contributing to the project's development!
