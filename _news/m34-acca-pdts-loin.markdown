We are excited to share an article by ACCA Software on the importance of Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) and their role within the RecycleBIM Project.
The construction sector faces challenges related to sustainability, efficiency, and digital transformation. In this context, EIRs support proactive and structured information management throughout the entire project lifecycle, facilitating collaborative information production and use.
The article outlines the development of EIRs, with a strong focus on material circularity and the advanced use of BIM. 
The work was elaborated in the project's scope of WP2 (BIM data specifications). We thank our partners, ACCA Software, for contributing to the project's development!
