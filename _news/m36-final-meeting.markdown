The RecycleBIM Project reached an important milestone with its final consortium meeting, held on April 3â€“4 in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The event was hosted with great hospitality by Stellenbosch University, the University of the Western Cape, and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. We are sincerely grateful for their warm welcome, which helped create a collaborative and collegial atmosphere throughout the two-day meeting.

During the gathering, project partners from both academia and industry presented the results achieved across various work packages. The agenda included detailed updates on case studies, followed by open discussions that encouraged the sharing of ideas, reflections, and next steps.

As the project approaches its conclusion, final reporting and evaluation activities are currently underway. These will be followed by a series of publications aimed at sharing key findings and highlighting the broader value and potential of the project.

Stay tuned for more updates and results from RecycleBIM in the coming months!
