The RecycleBIM consortium warmly congratulates our colleagues at the Universidade de Vigo for presenting their paper, “A SAM-Based Approach for Automatic Indoor Point Cloud Segmentation,” during the Digital Construction Workshop at ISPRS Geospatial Week 2025 (6–11 April, Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, Dubai).

Authored by M. S. A. Albadri, P. González-Cabaleiro, R. M. Túñez-Alcalde, A. Fernández and L. Díaz-Vilariño, the study adapts the Segment-Anything Model to 3-D indoor LiDAR data, helping speed up point-cloud-to-BIM workflows—an important step toward the circular-construction goals of RecycleBIM.

We congratulate the UVigo team on this achievement and thank them for advancing our shared goals.

As the project approaches its conclusion, final reporting and evaluation activities are currently underway. These will be followed by a series of publications aimed at sharing key findings and highlighting the broader value and potential of the project.

Stay tuned for more updates and results from RecycleBIM in the coming months!
