The RecycleBIM team was excited to participate in the CLBMCS 2024 conference, where we presented our latest research on advancing circularity in construction materials. Our paper, titled "Circularidade dos Materiais de Construção - Precedência entre Elementos Baseada em Modelos Digitais," explores new methodologies for prioritizing material reuse through digital modelling frameworks, contributing to a more sustainable construction industry.

RecycleBIM, funded by ERA-MIN, is dedicated to creating digital solutions that enhance the lifecycle management of construction materials, aiming to maximize resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This conference was a fantastic platform to showcase our progress and connect with like-minded professionals committed to circular economy principles.

Looking forward to continued discussions and collaborations on driving sustainability in the built environment!
